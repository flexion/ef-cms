        <h3>Change of Address:</h3>
        <p>You must notify the Clerk of the Court if you change your address. If you filed your petition in paper,
          see Tax
          Court Form 10, Notice of Change of Address, under “Forms” on the Tax Court’s Website at
          <b class="link">www.ustaxcourt.gov</b>
          . If you filed your petition electronically, you may update your address under the “Case Information” tab
          in your
          case online. Failure to notify the Clerk of the Court of a change of your address can mean you do not
          receive
          notices and documents essential to your case and can lead to dismissal of your case.
