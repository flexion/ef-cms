# EF-CMS Migration Documentation

* Cases can be added by POSTing JSON to `/migrate/case`
* PDF files can be added directly to the PDF S3 bucket, with UUIDV4s referenced as `documentId` in the Case objects.
* Authentication is handled by AWS Cognito. An account with the admin role is required.
* Values are validated using Hapi Joi schema definitions in the [Case](entities/Case.md), [Document](entities/Document.md) and [DocketRecord](entities/DocketRecord.md) entities.
* Case JSON generated by the EF-CMS can be viewed in the browser with developer tools for reference.
