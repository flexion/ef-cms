## Flexion Testing Approach

### Resources and Environments

#### Tools
* Cerebral Debugger
* Cypress
* ESLint
* Honeybadger
* Jest
* Pa11y
* Stylelint
* Voiceover
* ZenHub

#### Testing Environments
* Local - Developer machines
* Exp 1 - Experimental environment where engineers can test potential solutions
* Exp 2 - Experimental environment where engineers can test potential solutions
* Exp 3 - Experimental environment where engineers can test potential solutions
* Flexion dev - Development environment where new code is introduced and preliminarily tested
* Flexion stg - Staging environment used to match the Court’s production environment
* Flexion prod - The place where we replicate the Court’s production environment

### What We Are Testing

#### User Stories
For each user story that’s completed, the following testing is performed.

| Type of Testing  | Used for                                                     | Automated or Manual  | Test Data Creation                           | Tool                          | Responsible | Frequency/Environment             |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Experimental     | Testing potential engineering solutions without breaking dev | Automated and Manual | Test data manually created with smoke tests. | A variety of tools, as needed | Engineer    | * Exp1, Exp2 and Exp3 * As needed |
