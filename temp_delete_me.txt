Ideas for Approach:
- Keep Existing Case Sensitive User Pool (Dawson carries the lift)
  - Make DAWSON case insensitive, use list users function to find correct account (will need logic) to login with. 
      (No cleanup required + Additional work for login, forgot password, & e-access)
  - Make All user's emails/usernames lower case via migration script (will need logic to handle conflicts), covert user input toLowerCase(). 
      (Cleanup required +  Resolves Both Login + Forgot Password + E-Access)
- Migrate to New Case Insensitive User Pool (off load logic to aws)
      (Cleanup required + Resolves Both Login + Forgot Password)
  - Lambda Trigger (Can be on login and forgot password, e-access separate)
  - One time script + TF Infrastructure Update
  - One time lambda function + TF Infrastructure Update
  - CSV Import per Jim D. (Resets user passwords)

Assumptions:
- Password is always case sensitive. 
- Login and Forgot Password should function same (whether it should be a single ticket is TBD).

Questions:
- How many accounts are duplicated with different casing?
- What if duplicated accounts are on different cases?
- Do we want to update custom:userId as apart of this ticket? (Bonus)

Details:
- 11 @ustacourt.gov accounts
- 153 no cases created from any of the users; disable all but one
- 28 need to consolidate to one account
- 481 have an account with 0 cases that needs to be disabled
- 24 already have an account with 0 cases that has been disabled (nothing to do?)

Random: 
- Auth0 treats email as case insensitive by lowerCasing for you.
