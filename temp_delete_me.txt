Ideas for Approach:
- Keep Existing Case Sensitive User Pool
  - Make DAWSON case insensitive, use list users function to find correct account (will need logic) to login with. 
      (No cleanup required + Additional work for login & forgot password)
  - Make All user's emails/usernames lower case via migration script (will need logic to handle conflicts), covert user input toLowerCase(). 
      (Cleanup required +  Resolves Both Login + Forgot Password)
- Migrate to New Case Insensitive User Pool 
      (Cleanup required + Resolves Both Login + Forgot Password)

Assumptions:
- Password is always case sensitive.

Questions:
- How many accounts are duplicated with different casing?
- What if duplicated accounts are on different cases?
- Given we Migrate to New Case Insensitive User Pool, do we achieve this as a one time script, lambda function, or unique trigger?

Random: 
- Auth0 treats email as case insensitive by lowerCasing for you.
