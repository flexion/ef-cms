UX 
- [x] Add underlines under each accordion item in "Other Ways to File a Case"
- [x] Correct font-family for dashboard error banner title 
- [x] Should there be a way to clear the file in the input?
- [x] "File size is too big" warning appears as a JS alert by default; should it appear as a modal instead?
- [ ] Are all text changes deliberate? i.e. start case step 2

Engineering Questions/bug/TODOs
- [x] Files uploaded in step 2 clear out if you navigate back to step 2
- [x] Check validation logic to make sure ATPs documents are not required for creating electronic petitions. (currently does not get past review page)
- [x] small nit pick, how do we find a location to import event codes i.e `ATP_EVENT_CODE` in `petitionQcHelper.ts`
- [x] Add pdf validation icons for uploaded ATPs in `Tabs`
- [ ] How does validating that IRS was served when there are already ATP docs?
    - How can we confirm email was sent 'locally'? So far, I'm validating the logs in web api to see that destinations was populated
- [x] (Nechama) Clean up Multi Select File Input component
- [ ] write smoketests to anaylize the impact of 'processing' ATP when serving cases
- [ ] what validation sequence should be run on file upload?
- [x] Unit tests for creating ATPs
- [x] Unit tests for serving ATPs
- [x] cypress tests need to be updated
  - [x] `petitions-clerk-creates-a-case.cy.ts`
  - [x] `start-a-case-practitioner.cy.ts`
- [ ] Investigate other uses of `getDocumentSelectedForPreviewAction` to make sure fileMetaData usage makes sense
- [x] unit test `createCaseInteractor`
- [x] unit test `filePetitionInteractor.ts`
- [x] unit test `serveCaseDocument.ts`
- [ ] unit test `getDocumentSelectedForPreviewAction.ts`
- [x] unit test `createCaseAction.ts`


PO Questions
- [ ] When QCing an electronic petition, should the "IRS Notice Provided?" option default to the selection the petitioner made when creating it?
- [ ] Should the ATP tab show in the QC process when a case is filed electronically?

FileInput 
- [x] FileInput component does not properly set uploaded files in state if any of them are too large. the goal is to discard just the ones that are too large, not all of them.
- [x] files uploaded aren't showing on the review page
- [ ] change "change file" to "remove file" which resets component on click
- [ ] handle maximum number of files, block all files from being uploaded
- [ ] change file-too-large behavior to block all files from being uploaded
- [ ] Handle validation message for APT files in `shared/src/business/entities/cases/ElectronicPetition.ts`
