UX 


Engineering Questions/bug/TODOs
- [ ] How does validating that IRS was served when there are already ATP docs?
    - How can we confirm email was sent 'locally'? So far, I'm validating the logs in web api to see that destinations was populated
- [ ] write smoketests to anaylize the impact of 'processing' ATPs when serving cases
- [ ] CYPRESS test (cover the whole flow)

Validation
- [ ] What should the validation message for ATP files in `shared/src/business/entities/cases/ElectronicPetition.ts`
- [ ] How do we validate the file size in Electronic Petition? Its an array so how will that work?
    - Right now, we can validate against the number of files but not the size of each file in the array.
