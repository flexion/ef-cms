UX 
- [ ] Are all text changes deliberate? i.e. start case step 2
- [ ] Fix size of STIN icon in `web-client/src/views/CaseDetailEdit/Attachments.tsx`

Engineering Questions/bug/TODOs
- [ ] How does validating that IRS was served when there are already ATP docs?
    - How can we confirm email was sent 'locally'? So far, I'm validating the logs in web api to see that destinations was populated
- [ ] write smoketests to anaylize the impact of 'processing' ATPs when serving cases
- [ ] CYPRESS test (cover the whole flow)

Validation
- [x] Make `attachmentToPetitionFile` name in PaperPetition consistent with `atpFiles` in ElectronicPetition
- [ ] what is the validation message for APT files in `shared/src/business/entities/cases/ElectronicPetition.ts`?
- [ ] How do we validate the file size in Electronic Petition? Its an array so how will that work?
- [ ] what validation sequence should be run on file upload?
