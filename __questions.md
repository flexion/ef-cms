# questions for po/ux

1. In the Create Term modal, the Figma mockups state that the "next"
term types should display as options. What is the business relevance of
the "Trial term" and "Term name" fields?

2. Why even use the "Trial term" dropdown if the user is also providing
start and end dates, which are what the logic on the backend will actually
use to generate the proposed calendar.

# CreateTermModal

- Does the minimum date need to be in the future for the start date
field or should the user be allowed to generate a term with a start
date that is in the past?
