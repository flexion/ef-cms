As an open-source project, we rely on external libraries which get updates frequently. These include JavaScript Library Updates and Infrastructure as Code Libraries.

This issue template is used to be able to see a more accurate count of team WIP (Work in Process), as updating libraries can be a time-intensive task.

We use the [rotation schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G0RS1O0nSHUR7HhtFhMYvsxNW9U_WLKQqG05IxrTLmU/edit#gid=0) to know who's assigned to this issue, and the [documentation](https://github.com/ustaxcourt/ef-cms/blob/staging/docs/dependency-updates.md) for how we complete this.
